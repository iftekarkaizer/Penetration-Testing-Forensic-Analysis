1.Execution Process
The project follows a structured Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) approach, including:

Reconnaissance & Enumeration: Using Nmap to scan for open ports and vulnerable services.
Exploitation: Performing brute-force attacks on SSH using tools like Hydra and Nmap NSE scripts.
Post-Exploitation: Establishing access, modifying system settings, and capturing network traffic.
Network Traffic Capture & Analysis: Using tcpdump, Wireshark, and Security Onion to monitor SSH traffic.
Forensic Investigation: Analyzing logs, timestamps, and deleted files using forensic tools.
Threat Intelligence & Alerting: Leveraging Suricata IDS and Security Onion for attack detection and incident response.

2.Tools Used
Your project involves several penetration testing and forensic analysis tools, including:

Reconnaissance & Scanning
Nmap – For network scanning and service enumeration.
ipcalc – For subnet calculations.
Exploitation
Hydra – For SSH brute force attacks.
Metasploit – Potentially used for further exploitation.
Post-Exploitation
timedatectl – For timestamp manipulation and forensic timeline reconstruction.
useradd, chmod, rm – System commands for user management and file operations.
Network Traffic Capture & Analysis
tcpdump – Captures network packets.
Wireshark – Analyzes packet captures for attack traces.
Security Onion – Centralized log and network monitoring.
Suricata – IDS for detecting brute-force attacks.
Forensic Investigation & Log Analysis
Autopsy, FTK, or TheHive – Possible forensic tools for analyzing system artifacts.
Kibana – For visualizing attack data.

3.Cybersecurity Significance
From a cybersecurity perspective, your project highlights:

✅ Attack Simulation & Ethical Hacking
Demonstrates real-world attack vectors, such as brute-force SSH attacks.
Identifies weaknesses in SSH security configurations.

✅ Incident Detection & Response
Uses Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) like Suricata to trigger alerts for brute-force attempts.
Employs PCAP analysis to reconstruct attack timelines.

✅ Forensic Evidence Collection
Captures file modifications, user activity, and network traffic for forensic analysis.
Investigates deleted files, user account creations, and SSH access logs.

✅ Defensive Measures
Recommends countermeasures like Fail2Ban, SSH hardening, and log monitoring.
Provides insights into correlating forensic artifacts with security events.
